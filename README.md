# Chrome Extension v3 in CLJS

Ported [this example](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/17956f44b6f04d28407a4b7eee428611affd4fab/examples/water_alarm_notification) to use ClojureScript with shadow-cljs.

Clone this repo and run

```
npm install
#npx shadow-cljs watch ext
clj -M:shadow-cljs watch ext
# or
#npx shadow-cljs release ext
clj -M:shadow-cljs release ext
```

Then load the `ext` folder as an "Unpacked Extension" via [Chrome Extensions](chrome://extensions/).

Written using the "modern" [:target :esm](https://shadow-cljs.github.io/docs/UsersGuide.html#target-esm), which appears to work fine. Manifests no longer need to be modified by the build because ESM can load additional files on its own (as done with the `:shared` module).

Only relevant change over the JS version was adding `"type": "module` to the `"background"` in `manifest.json`. As well as `type="module"` in the `popup.html`.

For me the notification doesn't actually show and I'm not sure why. Might be because I blocked Chrome from showing Notifications, but I can't find any indicator about any of that. The code does load and run fine which is all I wanted to show.
